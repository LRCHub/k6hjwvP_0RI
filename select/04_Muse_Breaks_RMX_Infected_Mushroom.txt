Take it straight up and watch me get in
Feel it when the sun is up and let the vibe in
Don't you feel the rain drops are near
You're the only tool to break the music
And your time is so useless
And your days are not of muse breaks
Feel me get in
C'mon
Feel me get in
Oh yeah
Take me up and out
'Cause rainy days are all I feel
I'm walking about
I know that, there's no time
In the days of muse breaks
I had to hang on tight
Looking back I wish I had more time for, you...
Take it to your top and now watch me get in
Feel this on the sun and let the vibe in
Don't you feel the rain drops are near
You're the only tool for Reggae music
And your time is so useless
And your days are not a muse breaks
Feel me get in (feel me get in)
Feel me get in (feel me get in)
Feel me get in (feel me get in)
Ahhh Haaaaaaa
Ahhh Haaaaaaa!!!
Take it straight up and watch me get it
Feel it when the sun is up and let the vibe in
Don't you feel the rain drops are near
You're the only tool to break the music
And your time is so useless
And your days are not of muse breaks
Get in
Take it straight up and watch me get it
Feel it when the sun is up and let the vibe in
Don't you feel the rain drops are near
You're the only tool to break the music
And your time is so useless
And your days are not of muse breaks
Feel me get in
Feel me get in
Feel me get in, haaaaa ahhhhh
Haaaaahhhhh!
Take me up and out
'Cause rainy days are all I feel
I'm walking about
I know that, there's no time
In the days of muse breaks
I had to hang on tight
Looking back I wish I had more time for, you...
