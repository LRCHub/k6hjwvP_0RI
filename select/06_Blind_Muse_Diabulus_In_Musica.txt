Ancient curse within my mind (comes back over and over)
An expected nightmare (coming back every night)

You're afraid your end is near,
You cannot control your fears, your obsession feeds your empty
Imagination
You're afraid your end is near,
You cannot control your fears,
Your fixation keeps you chained to our will
The dice in all hands, the voice in all talks

Alight You will be reborn from your own ashes
Alive I'll be your muse eternally

Then a sudden gust of wind (goes back over and over)
Blowing my idle mind (it turns up the dead leaves)
You're afraid your end is near,
You cannot control your fears,
Your obsession feeds your empty imagination
You're afraid your end is near,
You cannot control your fears,
Your fixation keeps you chained to our will
Fills my head with dreams, mutters in my ears

Alight You will be reborn from your own ashes
Alive I'll be your muse eternally

Like warmth in a wintry night
A craving of destiny
Ink on a blank canvas, the one who brings eternity

A witness of a glorious past
Lines that remain unread
Waiting for the one who is touched by the grace of your magic spell
