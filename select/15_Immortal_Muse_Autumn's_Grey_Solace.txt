I never knew
I never knew
Time was ticking away
I never knew
I never knew
I was here to stay
I never knew
I never knew
I never knew
Time was a ticking bomb
I never knew
I never knew
Dreams can be real
I never knew
I never knew
I can heal

In my eyes
I will stay
Forever young this way
In my heart
I will stay
Forever young this way

I never knew
I never knew
I would hear your voice

I never knew
I never knew
I would have a choice
I never knew
I never knew
I never knew
I would remember your name

In my eyes
I will stay
Forever young this way
In my heart
I will stay
Forever young this way
In your eyes
I will stay
Forever young this way
In your heart
I will stay
Forever young this way

In a natural high
I will fly ahead
In a natural high
You will find me alone
In a natural high
I will fly away
In a natural high
A high
