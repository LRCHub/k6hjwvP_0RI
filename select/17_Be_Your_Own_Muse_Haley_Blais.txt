I wanna be the one that you know will be pretty without her clothes
But I'm joking around, I'm joking around instead
I wanna be the one that you kiss
Stroking my cheek, Haley you're hilarious
And you're joking around, you're joking around too
Oh why can't I be, why can't I be both to you?
I guess sometimes it's a hit or a miss and you lose
I guess sometimes you just have to be your own muse
I'm gonna be the one that you read, front page of the paper flung at your feet
And I'm doing fine, I'm doing fine on my own
And it turns out, it turns out that I can be both
I guess sometimes it's a hit or a miss and you lose
I guess sometimes you just have to be your own muse
I guess sometimes you just have to be your own muse
Be your own muse
Be your own muse
Be your own muse
